# Expense Tracker App

Hey! My name is Mohd. Kashif. I made this basic Expense Tracker website by just using very basic concepts of Reactjs, nothing more than that.

Website link - [Expense Tracker App](https://kashifiit.github.io/Reactjs_basic_project/)

## Features

1. You can make multiple list of items with their corresponding expenses.

2. You can see & delete a particular item in a list by opening list using it's list number shown on bottom most of the website.

3. You can even delete a whole list by clicking on delete button.

4. You can see there total expenses of each list and as well as total amount of expense on the top.

I had also try my best to make this website responsive, but it looks better on laptop
